                            Axisymmetric semi-analytical finite elements in Python

What is it?
===========

This repository contains the axisafe package which is an implementation of 
the axisymmetric finite elements in Python, following a publication in 
Computers & Structures. The code can be used to find mechanical waves
propagating axisymmetric structures, such as pipes. These can be free, buried
or submerged, and may contain a fluid inside. An arbitrary composition of layers
is allowed. 

A few examples corresponding to the cases considered in the aforementioned paper
are also included.
